# 🔬 False Position Method: Exponential Solver

A professional Numerical Analysis dashboard designed to solve transcendental and algebraic equations using the **Regula Falsi (False Position)** method. Developed specifically for computer engineering students and educators.

## 👥 Development Team
* **Andy Lasala** - Lead Developer
* **Francis Mangalindan** - Technical Collaborator

## 🚀 Features
* **Dynamic Equation Input:** Supports complex functions using standard Python mathematical syntax (e.g., `exp(x) - 20`).
* **Auto-Bracketing Logic:** Automatically detects if a chosen interval fails to bracket a root and expands the search range to ensure continuous computation.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Powered by **Plotly**, the dashboard provides a real-time graph of function behavior and the calculated root.
* **Step-by-Step Derivation:** A dedicated tab that provides a "long-hand" mathematical walkthrough of each iteration, including formula substitutions.
* **Accessibility-Focused UI:** Designed with a high-contrast "Mint & Navy" theme for better readability during classroom presentations.
* **Professional Export:** Allows users to download a full CSV report of all iteration data for documentation purposes.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Framework:** Streamlit (Web UI)
* **Mathematics:** SymPy (Symbolic math) & NumPy (Numerical calculations)
* **Graphics:** Plotly (Interactive charts)

## 📋 How to Use
1. **Input Function:** Enter the function in terms of $x$ (e.g., `exp(x) - 10`).
2. **Set Bounds:** Provide the lower ($a$) and upper ($b$) boundaries.
3. **Set Tolerance:** Define the precision level ($\epsilon$).
4. **Execute:** Click "Execute Full Analysis" to generate the root and the step-by-step report.

## 📚 About the Method
The **False Position Method** is a bracketing method that uses linear interpolation. It connects the function values at the boundaries with a straight line (chord) and finds where that line intersects the x-axis to estimate the next root.
